This case serves as an illustration how data science can help analytical chemistry, in-field analysis and ecology. An additional point to be stressed is the reality of the subject case. The best practice for data scientists always consists in facing difficulties present in real cases â€“ data cleaning, preparation, analysis of the data logic, strategy of the exploratory analysis and modeling. To be expert in a domain (area of knowledge, professional background) essentially facilitates and enhances the data interpretation. For example, all negative values mean that they are below the detection limit and, hence, were recoded into zero (0). The original dataset and the data description are attached. The present case is taken from the open [database](https://open.alberta.ca/opendata/domestic-well-water-quality-in-alberta-routine-chemistry). The analysis and modeling were conducted using JSL (SAS).
